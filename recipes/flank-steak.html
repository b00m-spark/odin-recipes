    <p>
        Juicy, flavorful, and perfectly seared, this marinated flank steak is a deliciously tender cut
         that's quick to cook and full of bold taste. Great for weeknight dinners or backyard grilling,
          it's a crowd-pleaser served sliced thin against the grain.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (1 1/2-pound) flank steak</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>⅓ cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill for about 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Remove from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
