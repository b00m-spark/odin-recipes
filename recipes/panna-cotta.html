    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup skim milk</li>
        <li>1 (0.25 ounce) envelope unflavored gelatin</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour milk into a small bowl. Sprinkle gelatin powder over milk and stir until combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir heavy cream and sugar together in a saucepan. Set over medium heat and bring to a boil; watch carefully as the cream can quickly bubble up and boil over.</li>

        <li>Remove the pan from the heat and stir in vanilla.</li>
        <li>Pour cream mixture into 6 individual ramekins. Leave to cool, uncovered, until no longer warm, about 20 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
